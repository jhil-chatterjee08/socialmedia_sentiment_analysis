1696093313.0,"The normalizing of taking ""mental health days"" is troubling","I'm absolutely a supporter of workers taking time off to maintain their mental well-being, but the idea that it's an acceptable and inherent bi-product of employers pushing workers beyond reasonable and healthy expectations of productivity is absolutely troubling.

That workers should spend their own sick days to cope with an ever-diminishing work-life balance rather than employers being forced to adhere to humane standards and expectations is absolutely maddening. We cannot accept a future where we're pushed to our absolute mental limits and have to choose when we can afford to spend a sick day to recharge.",antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/16wbzij/the_normalizing_of_taking_mental_health_days_is/

JB Pritzker said will inflict ""immeasurable harm.""
State officials learned this week of $28 million in previously approved grants that have been slashed from the Illinois Department of Human Services, while $125 million has been pulled back from the state Department of Public Health, officials said Wednesday.
The Trump administration is also blocking another $324 million in future public health department grants Illinois had been set to receive under the CARES Act, passed by Congress during Trump's first term in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Illinois cuts are part of $12 billion in grants that the federal Department of Health and Human Services canceled this week.",illinois,https://i.redd.it/wkl9xnh4eare1.jpeg
1750902474.0,AIO for ending a situationship over her mental health issues?,"These texts are fresh, like 1 hour ago. 

We are both 25. We met on a dating app and went on 2 dates. I had a lot of fun talking to her and she seemed like a great person. 

However, on the second date, she started going on and on about how she has undiagnosed PTSD and depression and anxiety and some other psychological disorders. She was using a lot of terminology that seemed to be straight out of TikTok like ‚Äúreparenting my inner child‚Äù or ‚Äúneeding a partner who can co-regulate‚Äù. 

I 100% understand that people can have various mental and physical health problems, but the way she talked about hers seemed immature, for lack of a better word. 

I may be an ass for this, but the conversation turned me off. It felt like she spent a lot of time on the internet and that‚Äôs just not my thing. Call me judgmental but I‚Äôve met enough people in my short life to get certain ‚Äúgut feelings‚Äù. 

I tried to let her down easy but the conversation on text went like this. 

At the end, I just responded like an asshole so that the conversation would end. Did I over-react? Am I not being sensitive enough to her health issues?

1753016657.0,Take all the time off you need for your ‚Äúmental health‚Äù my company said. That was a lie.,"I work for a large IT Cybersecurity company. It‚Äôs project work and on call. We have flexibility but it‚Äôs extremely stressful. We‚Äôre always told ‚Äútake whatever time off you need for your mental health‚Äù. I‚Äôve been there 20+ years and have never felt the need to do so until two weeks ago. About 5 weeks ago my father died, his sister (my aunt) died, and one of my adult children wound up in the hospital due to life threatening complications from childbirth, all within six days. My daughter and her baby are ok now. Anyway, when I approached my company about time off they said I could use my PTO (I have 2 days of PTO left, I get 10 a year) but then after that it would be noted as ‚Äúapproved, unpaid‚Äù leave. Anything that was ‚Äúmissed‚Äù by me during this time could reflect negatively during the next review cycle - so I was told. What a horrible system of time off this country (the USA of course) has and lack of concern for our workers. And employers wonder why everyone isn‚Äôt always happy.

1746981810.0,I love Overwatch 2 but it seems like its detrimental to my mental health,"TL;DR: Overwatch 2 is my favorite game. I don't want to play anything else, but at the same time, it makes me feel depressed. Do I just stop playing my favorite game?

  
Sorry but I have nowhere else to post this and no one to talk it with  
  
I feel miserable. I hate that I love this game, but people only use chats to flame. When I turn it off, they find some way to piss me off. Even when I'm winning, I still feel annoyed for some unknown reason. I hate that Sombra exists, I hate the unbalancing, I hate that even after taking a very long break I manage to experience this emotion that I've never felt anywhere else before and my chest feeling hot due to anger. Seriously I wish it was different. I really love this game, I even got addicted at some point. There have been a lot of times that it gets to my head and I want to just take it out on someone but maybe that's just online gaming for you, but OW2 is just different somehow

I just love this game. I dont want to play anything else, not MR, not TF2, and definitely not Paladins. I even learned Blender to create fanart. The picture is from an obscure animation that I made

How do I cope with this? Do I just stop playing my favorite game?
