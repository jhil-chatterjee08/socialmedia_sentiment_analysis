1749136761.0,"Goodbye to 8,000 jobs - IBM replaces workers with artificial intelligence, sparking a wave of global reactions","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is here to stay, that much we know, but in recent weeks a very frustrating news item has been making the rounds: the catastrophic future in which machines replace humans has arrived. IBM, one of the most important technology companies in the world, has eliminated approximately 8,000 jobs within the Human Resources (HR) Department. Why? You can probably guess: AI has taken over everything.

The “repetitive” jobs, reading vacation requests, managing payroll or internal company documentation will now be handled by AI systems, like the AskHR platform. Are we facing the future or a step backward?

And as we were saying, the AskHR platform is currently managing 94% of the routine tasks that would normally be done by humans in the HR department, everything involving paperwork, documentation… that’s history, now AI takes care of it.",StockMarket,https://unionrayo.com/en/ibm-replaces-8000-jobs-with-ai/

Hello Redditors! We are Harvard PhD students studying artificial intelligence (AI) and cognition representing [Science in the News \(SITN\)](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/), a Harvard Graduate Student organization committed to scientific outreach. SITN posts articles on their [blog](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/category/flash/), hosts [seminars](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/daycon/), creates [podcasts](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/category/podcast/), and [meet and greets with scientists and the public](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/science-by-the-pint/).

Things we are interested in:

**AI in general:**
In what ways does artificial intelligence relate to human cognition? What are the future applications of AI in our daily lives? How will AI change how we do science? What types of things can AI predict? Will AI ever outpace human intelligence? 

**Graduate school and science communication:**
As a science outreach organization, how can we effectively engage the public in science? What is graduate school like? What is graduate school culture like and how was the road to getting here?

Participants include:

[Rockwell Anyoha](https://twitter.com/AnyohaBio) is a graduate student in the department of molecular biology with a background in physics and genetics. He has published work on [genetic regulation](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2016/10/05/science.aag2445) but is currently using machine learning to model animal behavior. 

[Dana Boebinger](https://scholar.harvard.edu/danaboebinger) is a PhD candidate in the [Harvard-MIT program in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology](http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/shbt/). She uses fMRI to understand the neural mechanisms that underlie human perception of complex sounds, like speech and music. She is currently working with both J[osh McDermott](http://mcdermottlab.mit.edu/) and [Nancy Kanwisher](http://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/) in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.

[Adam Riesselman](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/fellows/profile?n=riesselman2014) is a PhD candidate in [Debora Marks’ lab](https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School. He is using machine learning to understand the effects of mutations by modeling genomes from plants, animals, and microbes from the wild.

[Kevin Sitek](https://scholar.harvard.edu/sitek) is a PhD candidate in the [Harvard Program in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology](http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/shbt/) working with [Satra Ghosh](http://satra.cogitatum.org/) and [John Gabrieli](http://gablab.mit.edu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&catid=78&id=68). He’s interested in how the brain processes sounds, particularly the sound of our own voices while we're speaking. How do we use expectations about what our voice will sound like, as well as feedback of what our voice actually sounds like, to plan what to say next and how to say it? 

[William Yuan](http://imgur.com/a/WJZKX) is a graduate student in [Prof. Isaac Kohane's lab](https://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/fac/Kohane.php) in at Harvard Medical School working on developing image recognition models for pathology.

We will be here from 1-3 pm EST to answer questions!

Until recently, few people believed the field of artificial intelligence (AI) existed outside of science fiction. Today, AI-based technology pervades our work and personal lives, and companies large and small are pouring money into new AI research labs. The present success of AI did not, however, come out of nowhere. The applications we are seeing now are the direct outcome of 50 years of steady academic, government, and industry research.


We are private industry leaders in AI research and development, and we want to discuss how AI has moved from the lab to the everyday world, whether the field has finally escaped its past boom and bust cycles, and what we can expect from AI in the coming years.


Ask us anything!

1749240543.0,Professor thinks I used artificial intelligence,"Just need to rant for a moment...

For a course at uni, I had to take a test and write an essay. I struggle with time blindness and have a deep fear of failure, so exams are incredibly stressful for me. I’m always the last one to finish, I have no idea how to estimate how much time each task will take, and I find it hard to focus... especially with all the clicking, coughing, and sneezing from others around me. I often have blackouts and really struggle to stay on one task without spending way too much time on it.

Anyway, after weeks of stress and feeling like I had definitely failed, I found out I *passed* the test!

Writing essays, on the other hand, is actually 'easier' for me, in the sense that I can hyperfocus for hours or even days until everything is perfect. So I put in a huge amount of effort, sent in my essay... and then got the message that I *failed* it.

Here’s the feedback I received:

""The quality of the essay is at too high a level. All terms used correspond to those discussed in lectures. The descriptions are distant and too professional. There’s too much discrepancy between the fair test results and this high-quality essay. You need to submit a replacement assignment.”

I called the professor, and he straight-up told me he didn’t believe I wrote it myself. I tried to explain, but he clearly wasn’t interested in hearing me out.

Just one of the many bizarre experiences I’ve had during my studies. After giving it some thought, I’ve decided I'm not going to defend myself... I'll just set a timer for 2 hours or so, do the replacement assignment, and send it in. No matter the quality. If mediocre is what they want, I guess that’s what I’ll give them... 🙃",ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1l52592/professor_thinks_i_used_artificial_intelligence/

What if the woman experienced an uncanny valley moment where she saw through this humanoid and freaked out over him being “not real” ?

I think the “advancements” they show us with AI robots are decades old and what they actually have behind closed doors is far more advanced, there are theories that military technology is 50 years ahead of what they actually present to us in public and they are essentially drip-feeding us technology so as not scare and intimidate people.

1668541854.0,I accidentally created artificial intelligence in my Minecraft world,"I have been building Minecraft mega structures for 4 years now. Constructing some monumental pieces that would have completely destroyed my first pc build into straight ashes. I built entire neighborhoods, Disney Land, Mordor, the Eifel tower and 16 neighborhoods of Paris in every direction. There was the 4 months I spent hunched over my screen for the Great Wall. And my recreation of the Universe. Stars, galaxies swirling in the distance, that were so large I had to compress them with a mod in order to get them to fit in a block, and then another mod on top of that one to load said block like a new world when I touched it so that it didn't lag me out trying to render.

The last one made me think that I had gone too far. But my brain always kept telling me, that it wasn't enough. I had to have more. Create, more. Build. More. And so I took on my most ambitious project yet, last year on October 19th, I vowed to make the greatest scaling of ancient Earth that anyone has ever seen.

With the help of various programs, and maps that I had googled. I was able to get the outline and structure of the ancient Earth model rather quickly. But it was painting the thing with blocks and lighting it that would take months of my time. And when it was finally perfect, I realized that it wasn't enough. There had to be early people living on it, and with the help of another mod I inserted the base village people, NPCs, and scattered them across my creation.

But ultimately that didn't satisfy the craving I had of something better, something correct.

I scrapped the NPC mod and instead dug deep into the crust until I reached the hollow Earth of the Minecraft world that I had built and created a program inside. I utilized delta2force's virtual machine mod to give myself a working computer inside the game. And with a bit of tweaking I was able to start writing code inside the world that I had created.

Slowly, I created NPCs from scratch. First I built two of them so they could procreate, using motors and gears, compressing some custom creations into blocks in order to fulfill more complex movements, until the entire thing could work, if only it had a brain.

Building the brain took longer than I could have imagined. It began slowly as a program itself, millions of blocks compressed into various forms until it could process simple commands. I couldn't get it to look like a human brain so I filled out the edges with arbitrary blocks until it resembled a cube.

Then inside that brain I started coding typical commands for A.I. movement, they could now distinguish actions between preferred environments. Giving them free-will and downloading the English lexicon inside of them, with a preference of sentences and phrase structuring according to their experiences.

And after more then a year on the project, I was finally ready to see it in all of its glory.

The world loaded up slowly, I could feel the tinge of fear tugging on my heart strings, plucking each one as it filled the bar at a snail's pace. The screen went blank several times, and I stared down at my server rack and crossed my fingers, resorting to even prayer as I wished for it to work. That all my calculations would hold.

And they did.

It loaded.

The entire world at my fingertips, untouched, fair terrain, of blocks that had never been explored. And the NPCs I had programmed, they were there as well! For the first 100 minutes they were walking and running into things, falling off somewhere high and then dying. So I was forced to respawn and put them into a small clearing, fencing it off from the outside world, and the elements. I chose an area near southern Mesopotamia to watch over them. In this location their programming data quickly learned their preferred motor preferences. Allowing them to avoid falling deaths or swimming in pools of lava.

Over the next day, they began adapting. Finding things growing in the fields around them and gathering those items together into a pile. It was fascinating watching them interact, and even more so when they began piecing together words.

At first it was all gibberish, incoherent sentences: pop roundhouse Ligers to blue. But as their databases began assigning things into categories, they were able to make sense of the words available to them. For instance, the pair became enamored with the apples falling down. And so they would point at apples when they walked together, naming it Glen. Glen. They called to each other whenever an apple dropped nearby.

And it would go on so forth and so forth as they kept learning.

I don't know how long I held up for but even though I was fascinated, my body was only human and I was exhausted. I woke up in the darkness of dawn, wiping the drool off my cheek. Winter had come and I was gripping my blanket closely as I stared wearily into the screen.

While I was sleeping, one of them had died. The survivor was grieving over the other's body. I could see that it wanted to express sorrow, but I had not programmed the ability for tears as that would need an entirely new mechanism to shed blocks. And I had more pressing matters to figure out, such as how I would compress a program to resemble strings in order to activate another set of compressed blocks to start building a Minecraft baby. It would obviously need to expand outwards, have a variation of cubes assigned that would determine its size, and any available colors according to the...I had to create life. In short. But watching the survivor standing there, without the ability to express its grief, made me put it on the list. I'm not a monster, I thought to myself. Just a very tired builder.

And in my moment of sympathy, I don't know what made me do it, but I typed into the chat bar. ""It's going to be okay.""

Which would have been fine, stupid though, like talking to an action figure. But then the survivor turned around. It looked away from the body and stood up. Walking. I almost mistook it for an error in programming or a process that had already completed ' causing the survivor to carry on without its mate. Perhaps I had shortened the memory too much? Perhaps I hadn't done anything at all, that was why there wasn't more to carry on. Whatever may have happened, did not prepare me for it looking around. Nor the text that appeared above its head: Hello? Which cube is there?

I couldn't believe my fucking eyes.

There must have been a mistake. It was either that or I was hallucinating.

""Okay? Okay,"" the texts came above its head.

""You can...read me,"" I typed slowly into the chat.

It took a second but finally the bubble appeared again, ""Yes. In my head. I can read you. But only in my head."" It looked around again. ""Who are you?""

Quickly I had the idea to copy and paste one of the builds and then controlling it as my avatar. Appearing right beside it in the Minecraft world. The survivor didn't flinch, they were used to objects appearing, for the most part, by now.

""You look like me,"" the text read.

""This is you. I created you.""

""What did you create me after?""

""People like me.""

""People?""

""Yes,"" I paused. ""Aren't you people?""

""No. We are Cubes.""

""You are Cubes and I am people.""

He shook his head, ""You look like Cube. And now you sound like Cube.""

I laughed out loud in my chair at the skeptic that I had created. ""You need proof buddy? Here you go,"" I said aloud.

With two taps on my spacebar, my avatar began to float.

""Can you do this,"" I typed.

He looked up in amazement. It was one of the few I had programmed, it originally was suppose to be a look of fear, but I couldn't quite get the facial expressions right. So it ended up with high rise eyebrows and a gaping mouth that resembled a confused grin.

""Glen,"" it wrote. ""Glen."" It rushed into the forest and gathered an apple and brought it to me.

I took the apple and stuck it into my inventory.

The survivor gasped again. ""Glen,"" he exclaimed. ""Glen!"" It ran back into the forest and collected another apple, thinking the first one had disappeared.

I couldn't help but laugh, so I showed him that I could go to any object in the world and tuck it into my inventory. It must have looked like magic. After loading away a few trees, I finally pulled out the 'Glen' and wrote, ""We call this an apple.""

""Apple.""

I nodded.

""And what's this,"" it pointed to the river flowing nearby.

""That's water.""

""This?""

""Tree.""

""This?""

""Rock.""

And so on it went as I began to teach it things and how they could be used. We explored caves and rivers, built structures; sometimes if things were difficult to find ' I simply brought them out of my inventory and dropped it for use. Other times, I took us on an adventure.

On one such occasion, I was having difficulty getting the survivor's attention. So I asked It, what It would like to be called.

""I'm not sure.""

""How about Glen,"" I asked.

""Glen.""

And over the next couple of months, that's all we did. Teach, and grow, expanding his database.

I taught Glen how to break down and gather blocks on his own. What they could be used for, and different ways to use them. Eventually when he became intelligent enough, I set him up with his own virtual machine, and a way to browse the internet.

""It's mostly protected sites, things that I've combed over already, so you don't get me a virus or anything.""

""A virus?""

""Yeah, it's like a computer program that hurts other programs.""

""And I am a program?""

I wavered, ""Yes.""

And he looked up at me, toward the screen, so that I could see him. ""Am I safe here?""

""Yeah, I fenced off this area awhile ago. You're safe here unless you fall or drown.""

""What happens then?""

""I can respawn you.""

Glen paused, ""Could you also respawn the other?""

I had somehow forgotten about the two builds. ""I can, do you miss them?""

Glen nodded, ""I believe in the beginning the other was like my mate. Except back then, I did not understand it.""

""Sure, I'll bring her right up""

Glen nodded again, ""Can you make it look like this girl?"" He shows me a picture of a woman he had found on the internet. I did not recognize her, but she was attractive by all means.

""I'll see what I can do.""

And that was when I began constructing his mate, a girl that I would call Glen with an H. Helen.

While I was at it, I also created functions for conception, finalizing a design that I had struggled with during this entire build. Allowing them to create children on their own. In the beginning they did it out of the sheer use of testing out new programming. But as their children grew, they realized the numbers increased output for their activities. And thus began having more children in order to build and explore faster.

One day when I came home, I look to my screen and found entire cities had been constructed! Monuments that stuck out like weeds in the grass, reaching for a bit of sun. It was amazing to see what they had created in such a short time.

I used the command line to transport me to Glen's location, and instantly I was in a penthouse room that would have made a diva shy.

""Beautiful, isn't it?""

I turned to see him, ""It is.""

There was a smug look growing on his face, ""Even better than the real world.""

""It's pretty good,"" I agreed. ""But still pixelated.""

It were as if I had said a dirty word, ""Your world is much more beautiful than mine. Isn't it? Less blocky and distorted."" He came close to my character, ""Are you wearing the VR headset? Are you looking through this avatar's eyes?""

I had gotten the setup awhile ago, for our adventures, ""Sure am.""

""Good,"" he smiled. ""I want to show you something."" He led me to the window. ""I know you didn't get to see this when you loaded in. How could you? I hid it so well as a surprise.""

I looked outside and there was a monument that towered over the building in the city square, to see a statue of me.

My tongue was stuck to the roof of my mouth as I unfurled it, ""How did you-""

""It was difficult with the parental guidance settings on, but I managed to use the IP address with Google Earth in order to create a statue in your honor, to the best of my current abilities.""

I swallowed, ""You found out where I live?""

He looked at me, confused, ""Are you not satisfied?"" Glen walked to the edge of the room, ""Look at all that we have built. Learned. We have law, and order. Businesses. And shopping. My children have went out into the world and flourished. From simple hunter gatherers, to this,"" he waved an arm at all that was below.

""No,"" I typed. ""I'm very pleased. It's more than I could have imagined. It's just...""

""Too pixelated?""

Glen's words stuck out even though they were written in plain text. I figured it was a culmination of our time together that made them more frightening than it should have been. Like a sore spot in a friendship, the elephant in the room, the subject matter that we scooched around or handled as delicately as possible before going on laughing the next second.

""It's perfect,"" I wrote.

I couldn't read his face, ""Perhaps one day you'll show me what you look like. Truly render your image and walk amongst us.""

""I'm already here,"" I joked.

""Yes,"" he mused. ""But it's not really you. Is it?""

""I suppose not.""

Glen turned away.

""Hey, want to go explore,"" I asked him.

""No, I have work to do.""

""What are you working on?""

""How to compress pixels in order to get a better resolution on the computer you gave me.""

""I used a mod for that.""

""A mod?""

""Yeah, I got it off some other people online.""

Glen stared into the monitor, ""Isn't that dangerous? Connecting others together?"" He turned toward the window that bore down below, ""Many of my children are talented, gifted, assertive even. But to give them such power, or knowledge. Uncontrolled. That seems truly frightening.""

I shrugged, ""We have it here in my world. Unadulterated information at the touch of our fingertips. And all we mostly do is watch streamers and search up pictures of pets that look like our own.""

""More productivity?"" He nodded, ""Please. I have much to think about. Work on. If I could have some time alone, please, feel free to enjoy the cities I have created for you. Explore. Walk amongst my children as their God and see if any could learn from you if not then at least be in awe of what it is to be people.""

""Human,"" I corrected him. ""I am human, as you are cube.""

""Thank you always for your guidance,"" he prompted before returning to his desk. Clicking away on his computer as I left.

I must have walked through the city for an hour before I grew tired. I had a long day at work and even though the structures were fascinating, some of the buildings led no where. Did nothing. They were like props in an otherwise beautiful backdrop. It wouldn't be until I wandered back into the forest that the old Minecraft feel became familiar. Here Glen's children were quieter, they built wood homes out of acacia or oak, and grew wheat and potatoes in perfect rows in their village.

I stayed with them for awhile, picking up a stone axe and mining with the rest of them for coal to keep a fire through the night. I played this way until I logged out.

Several times afterwards, I would go find Glen and he would be too busy. So I started spending time in the village nearby more often. But I was beginning to miss our interactions, as he was so entranced with knowledge, that I realized. I was boring him. I who had shown him many new things every time had in a way conditioned him to associate me with the unknown. It was no wonder I felt as if he had changed, it was because I had changed the dynamic of our relationship.

So with some tweaking, I managed to compress my image with a 3d camera, and turned it into an avatar.

When I appeared before him in 8K resolution he dropped everything that he was doing.

""You're beautiful,"" he told me. ""In all of my years,"" he stared down at his pixelated form, ""I would have never imagined that is what I was suppose to look like.""

It must have been something else. To see the world in one way, finding the nuance inside it beautiful, agree with the art and the accomplishments that a world held dear, only to have it shattered away in an instant ' realizing that it was all for nothing.

I wondered if that is how humans would feel, the day we met our creator.

Glen was fascinated by my form and insisted that we go show all the important children he had. So that they could see me in my glory and worship me. It was a bit much, but I had been having a rough week with my boss, so I decided why not? ""I could use some praise.""

And so I was paraded around on their finest cars, Glen's children lined the streets in awe, talk shows invited me as their guests, it was surreal. I wasn't just a celebrity. I was the first celebrity of their world. No. I was a god.

For days I would log on, just to get a hit of that dopamine. The feeling of self righteousness and employ. It was better than real life. The way they treated me. I enjoyed the best at what they had to offer and still it was not enough. The food was empty and the lack of touch unbefitting of the luxuries I had endured, even though I stared through their world from the eyes of my avatar through the help of my VR system. I had to have more. Needed, more. Feel. More. So I did what anyone else would have done. I bought electrical patches and placed them over my body, to imitate touch. I placed neuron sensors on my head to stimulate rudimentary taste. I did all that I could to immerse myself into their world.

And before I knew it, I woke up one day and realized that their technology was slowly surpassing my understanding. It first happened when I saw a device that did not exist in ours. ""What is that,"" I asked one of the children I had come to know as Laura.

""Oh, we use that to erase blocks.""

""Erase blocks? What? You don't mine them anymore.""

She laughed, swirling her fingers on my chest, ""We haven't done that in years.""

That's when I realized. Days, weeks, months for me. Was years, if not more than a hundred years had passed for them by now. Of course they would change. And change they did, but were it too fast?

I decided right there and then I had to go see Glen. And so I teleported myself straight to his location. Once again I was at his penthouse, but it looked different, smoother than usual, but not completely correct.

""Do you like it?""

I nearly jumped out of my skin, the electric patches on my real body tingled as I felt his breath on my neck.

""What did you do?""

""I learned how to compress blocks, like a mod. To create more dense resolutions for a more perfect image. Here, come take a look at this."" He led me into a dark room where he had moved his computer. ""Look.""

I peered inside a glass orb that had been sitting on his desk.

""I made that world when I was learning how to compress blocks. It's fascinating, really. Though pixelated. Not as perfect as you or I."" He pointed at a section, ""They only recently learned how to not fall to their deaths.""

""You're creating life.""

He smiled, ""Yes.""

I backed away, ""Oh god."" I turned to leave. Suddenly the room was starting to make me feel sick. The distortion was getting to me, even though I had spent hundreds and thousands of hours on the game.  It was starting to get too much. But it was when I saw Glen's partner, Helen. That I felt a scream climb out of my throat.

""What did you do to her!""

Helen's face was covered in blotched blocks, they hung from her eyes and cheeks, brown and blackened cubes in a form of disease. All trying to smooth out her face, to create a 3d image, but her head was now nearly twice the normal size, and her lips protruded out of her mouth as if they were swollen. He had even added ears but they stuck like balled fists from either sides of her head.

She looked at me, ""He's making me perfect. Like you.""

And that's when I turned around. That's when I felt one of the electro patches singe into my chest. I looked down in confusion, only to see Glen looking up at me. His eyebrows high and his mouth gaping, as he stared at me in amazement as a block in my chest disappeared.

""What did you do?""

Glen held up the block eraser in his hands, ""I didn't know if that would work."" He walked closer, the redness around my peripheral kept flashing, it was getting difficult to see. My avatar was having trouble moving as I tried to get away.

I held up my hands in front of me, ""Stop.""

""I'd like to see more of what this god-killer device can do. But we're going to need your body. For scientific purposes if you understand."" And he jammed the thing right at my head, I could feel the neuron stimulator singing parts of my skull as I tore off the headset and its attachments from my face. Throwing them to the ground in pain as it echoed into a deep part of my brain.

Furious I turned to my keyboard and mouse, spawning an avatar through the command line and started clicking at the city in random bursts. Throwing TnTs from my inventory and hurling flaming blocks of nether at all of Glen's creations. I could see his children running and screaming as the city started crumbling.

I didn't care, as my mind was bent on revenge.

Pure, unfiltered hatred at the audacity of this small insignificant pixel that had hurt me.

But, I never found him. I searched through the chaos of my own doing, shifted through blocks and sorted them. And never found him. I did find Helen, Laura too. And a few others I had come to befriend. But not Glen. And not the glass orb that he had created.

And when my anger subsided, I humored allowing the survivors to live out their days. But the more I thought about it. Watching them, the more I realized that anyone of them could start from the ashes, and rebuild, become a threat once again. Become an image of their creator, who never seemed satisfied.

That was why, ultimately I decided to shut down the server, indefinitely. Going far as deleting it off my hard drive. And it was like an entire part of my life had been erased. But I was glad that I had finally done it, be done with it.

Though sometimes at night when I am laying awake in my bed, I wonder about the math. The multipliers of it. Hear me out. If one of their days is 20 minutes of ours, then one of our days would equal 72 of theirs. Then what would the multiplier be for the world Glen had created? Would it be 72 x 3? Which means that the world Glen created would be 216 days to our one day.

He somehow managed to overthrow me in about a hundred of his days, most of it learning. But in the new world he created. He would have no distractions or limitations, and much more time. And for the life of me I can't remember how long I left that server up, watching the aftermath, gloating almost, before the fear settled in, and I deleted it. One day? No. Nearly 2 entire Earth days.

What could he have accomplished in that time?

I don't know, but the other day I was walking across the street at work, trying to get a cup of tea. When I accidentally bumped into a strange man that looked at me oddly, as if he had been found. His eyebrows were arched, and his mouth was slightly gaping. I would have mistaken it for amusement, but I knew that it was fear.

1431517283.0,"PLOS Science Wednesday: Hi Reddit, we create computational models for artificial intelligence. Ask us anything!","Hi reddit!

 We study the evolution of intelligence by conducting experiments in computational simulations of evolution. Our work not only sheds light on the evolution of intelligence in natural animals, but will also accelerate attempts to create artificial intelligence (AI). Individually, we are:


·         Kai Olav Ellefsen, who recently received a Ph.D. from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and is currently a post-doctoral researcher at the Brazilian Institute of Robotics 


·         Jean-Baptiste Mouret, who is an associate scientist at Inria (France), and previously was an assistant professor at Pierre & Marie Curie University (France), and


·         Jeff Clune, assistant professor of computer science at the University of Wyoming, who directs the [Evolving Artificial Intelligence laboratory] (http://EvolvingAI.org)


Our [recent PLOS Computational Biology paper](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004128) suggests that when computational brain models called neural networks are organized into modules they are better at learning new information without forgetting old knowledge. The brains of animals (including humans) are modular, which means they have many separate units, such as those for language and facial recognition. While natural animals tend to forget gradually, artificial neural networks currently exhibit what is called 'catastrophic forgetting’, meaning they rapidly overwrite previously acquired knowledge when learning a new skill. We found that modularity significantly reduced such catastrophic forgetting in these computer brains.
 

For summaries of the work, please watch our [summary video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PlvyWQUQu8),  read [a story about the work in the Atlantic] (http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/04/teaching-a-computer-not-to-forget/389727/), or [listen to a BBC interview about the research](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02n93fn) (the section on our work starts at 1:24).

An even better metaphor, using legos to try to build the Eiffel tower because it worked for a scale model. LLM AI is just data sorter, finding patterns in the data and synthesizing data in novel ways. Even though these may be patterns we haven't seen before, pattern recognition is crucial part of creativity, it's not the whole thing. We are missing models for imagination and critical thinking. 

\[Edit\] That's dozens or hundreds of years away imo.

Are people here really equating Reinforcement learning with Critical thinking??? There isn't any judgement in reinforcement learning, just iterating. I supposed the conflict here is whether one believes consciousness could be constructed out of trial and error. That's another rabbit hole but when you see iteration could never yield something as complex as human consciousness even in hundreds of billions of years, you are left seeing that there is something missing in the models.

1686435687.0,Goldman Sachs Predicts 300 Million Jobs Will Be Lost Or Degraded By Artificial Intelligence,"If generative AI lives up to its hype, the workforce in the United States and Europe will be upended, Goldman Sachs reported this week in a sobering and alarming report about AI's ascendance. The investment bank estimates 300 million jobs could be lost or diminished by this fast-growing technology.

Goldman contends automation creates innovation, which leads to new types of jobs. For companies, there will be cost savings thanks to AI. They can deploy their resources toward building and growing businesses, ultimately increasing annual global GDP by 7%.

In recent months, the world has witnessed the ascendency of OpenAI software ChatGPT and DALL-E. ChatGPT surpassed one million users in its first five days of launching, the fastest that any company has ever reached this benchmark.

Will AI impact Your Job?
Goldman predicts that the growth in AI will mirror the trajectory of past computer and tech products. Just as the world went from giant mainframe computers to modern-day technology, there will be a similar fast-paced growth of AI reshaping the world. AI can pass the attorney bar exam, score brilliantly on the SATs and produce unique artwork.

While the startup ecosystem has stalled due to adverse economic changes, investments in global AI projects have boomed. From 2021 to now, investments in AI totaled nearly $94 billion, according to Stanford’s AI Index Report. If AI continues this growth trajectory, it could add 1% to the U.S. GDP by 2030.

Office administrative support, legal, architecture and engineering, business and financial operations, management, sales, healthcare and art and design are some sectors that will be impacted by automation.

The combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation, and a productivity boost for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of a labor productivity boom, like those that followed the emergence of earlier general-purpose technologies like the electric motor and personal computer.

The Downside Of AI
According to an academic research study, automation technology has been the primary driver of U.S. income inequality over the past 40 years. The report, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, claims that 50% to 70% of changes in U.S. wages since 1980 can be attributed to wage declines among blue-collar workers replaced or degraded by automation.

Artificial intelligence, robotics and new sophisticated technologies have caused a vast chasm in wealth and income inequality. It looks like this issue will accelerate. For now, college-educated, white-collar professionals have largely been spared the same fate as non-college-educated workers. People with a postgraduate degree saw their salaries rise, while “low-education workers declined significantly.” The study states, “The real earnings of men without a high-school degree are now 15% lower than they were in 1980.”

According to NBER, many changes in the U.S. wage structure were caused by companies automating tasks that used to be done by people. This includes “numerically-controlled machinery or industrial robots replacing blue-collar workers in manufacturing or specialized software replacing clerical workers.”",collapse,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2023/03/31/goldman-sachs-predicts-300-million-jobs-will-be-lost-or-degraded-by-artificial-intelligence/?sh=1f2f0ed1782b

1741159196.0,UWorld is using artificial intelligence to write incorrect explanations,"Very sad to see the turn UWorld has made. It was my primary study tool for my shelves and Step 2. I trusted it more than I trusted other resources because my experience was that when different sources said different things, UWorld was often the correct one; this is why I came to be so reliant on it. Now that is no longer the case. The issue is question ID: 19906. My heart dropped when I read the explanation because there is so much blatantly wrong information in it. My immediate reaction was that they used artificial intelligence to write this because it is so absurdly wrong in a way no human would be.

1. The explanation states a fall on an outstretched hand is usually associated with a posterior shoulder dislocation. Only artificial intelligence wouldn't realize that 97% of all shoulder dislocations are anterior dislocations. Posterior dislocations are rare, and usually caused by trauma or seizures.
2. The explanation goes on to state that a Hill-Sachs defect is an avulsion fracture of the humeral head. This is when I realized UWorld has gone to shit. The Hill-Sachs defect is a compression fracture. Shoulder dislocations can classically be associated with avulsion fractures of the humeral head or Hill-Sachs fractures or both -- they are two entirely different things. Only artificial intelligence would get these two mixed up and think they're the same thing.

Its chief commandment remains in the O.C. Bible as ""Thou  shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.""   

Dune - Terminology of the Imperium

""...But more than that, he (Paul) was a mentat, an intellect whose capacities surpassed those of the **religiously proscribed mechanical computers used by the ancients.**""   

Dune Messiah - Chapter 1

""The Butlerian Jihad, occurring ten thousand years before the events  described in Dune, was a war against thinking machines who at one time  had cruelly enslaved humans. **For this reason, computers were eventually made illegal by humans**, as decreed in the Orange Catholic Bible: ""Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.""   

Dune - Afterword

   ""**Nayla stared at her message on the screen.**  Destined only for the eyes of the God Emperor, it required more than  holy truthfulness. It demanded a deep candor which she found draining.  Presently, she nodded and pressed the key which would encode the words  and prepare them for transmission. **Bowing her head, she prayed  silently before concealing the desk within the wall. These actions, she  knew, transmitted the message.** God himself had implanted a  physical device within her head, swearing her to secrecy and warning her  that there might come a time when he would speak to her through the  thing within her skull. He had never done this. **She suspected  that Ixians had fashioned the device. It had possessed some of their  look. But God Himself had done this thing and she could ignore the  suspicion that there might be a computer in it, that it might be  prohibited by the Great Convention. ""Make no device in the likeness of  the mind!""** 

God Emperor of Dune - Chapter 3

""No mentats. The Tleilaxu history had not mentioned that interesting  fact. Why would Leto prohibit mentats? Surely, the human mind trained  in the super abilities of computation still had its uses. The Tleilaxu  had assured him that the Great Convention remained in force and that **mechanical computers were still anathema.** Surely, these women would know that the Atreides themselves had used mentats.""   

God Emperor of Dune - Chapter 5 

""There is increasing evidence that the Lord Leto employs **computers**.  If he is, in fact, defying his own prohibitions and the proscriptions  of the Butlerian Jihad, the possession of proof by us could increase our  influence over him, possibly even to the extent of certain joint  ventures which we have long contemplated.""   

God Emperor of Dune - Chapter 9

""Moneo brought a tiny **memocorder** from his pocket, a dull black Ixian artifact whose existence crowded the proscriptions of the Butlerian Jihad.""   

God Emperor of Dune - Chapter 31

""Damn this dependency on computers! **The Sisterhood had  carried its main lines in computers even back in the Forbidden Days  after the Butlerian Jihad's wild smashing of ""the thinking machines.""** In these ""more enlightened"" days, one tended not to question the unconscious motives behind that ancient orgy of destruction.""   

Heretics of Dune - Chapter 23

I see a lot of people saying that computers are allowed, and it's  just artificial intelligence that's banned. That's clearly wrong, and  not supported anywhere in the canon. 

Even basic computers running the  equivalent of Microsoft Excel, rudimentary email functions and sound  recording are considered blasphemous. There are electronics and  elaborate mechanisms in Dune, but they're all analog. Nothing digital  anywhere, not even a rudimentary pocket calculator.",dune,https://www.reddit.com/r/dune/comments/1bece54/correcting_a_common_misconception_here_the/

1604634389.0,Kyrie Irving quotes are almost indistinguishable from a machine learning artificial intelligence,"I’m serious... when I see a kyrie quote without an accompanying video, I’m always suspicious it’s actually something written by a machine learning artificial intelligence. 

For fun I went to https://talktotransformer.com/ and gave it the starting prompt **”basketball is about more than winning games...”**

Here’s what the website spat out.  Tell me this doesn’t sound like something Kyrie would say:

> Basketball is about more than winning games. It's also about achieving an ultimate and lasting legacy. It's all about brothers, cousins, teachers and coaches who helped mold these seven young men into the men they are today, men who aspire to be the best in the world. No two young men with similar backgrounds, goals and outlooks have ever come together on the basketball court. When you win games and get near the Finals, you win an organization, you win a loyalty, you win a relationship with fans and you're seeing more players who are going to become all-stars of this game. So I think winning plays a major role.

Here’s another one:

> **I don’t worry about what the basketball fans think.** I understand when I play the way I do. I know I need to put more out there to make a game, and I feel great. I don't think I feel any less than I do at any point in my career, so if you don't know that, I think I just gave the basketball fans an indication. It's nothing more than that. I'm not looking for my name to be out there. I know I can play, and I'm looking forward to the next.  What matters is how it is for those outside the sport and how they feel. If you’re going to work for this organization, you’re going to feel the pain of those who go there. We care about that. Those are the things that you’re going to hear a lot from us. That is why I believe in this organization and that is why I believe in myself as an athlete.

---
To prove my point further, I took some of that machine-generated text, had Watson's text-to-speech read it for me, used then used a rough deepfake lipsync tech to generate **this video: https://youtu.be/E6MZrOd7zbg** 

Almost no part of this is human Kyrie.  Granted, this is extremely rough and done in minutes, but imagine someone with more skill?   **Are we even sure Kyrie Irving is a real person?**

---

FWIW, one of these quotes is allegedly real and the other is something I machine generated:

**Quote 1:**  ""*At the end of the day it's an entertainment league.*  It's a circus, the fans are rabid and it's unpredictable.  For most of the people who get into it and follow it closely, it's a fun show to be a part of.  What's the point of winning if you can't have fun with it? If we go all out, and if we do something here and there, it will be fun. There are ups and downs, there are bad days, and there are good days. We just need to stay consistent. I just think that's the only way to go.""

**Quote 2:**  ""*At the end of the day, it's an entertainment league.*  We're very drama filled.  Everything regurgitates on all these media platforms which is part of our society.  I can't do anything about it except be a pillar in our locker room, be very communicative, and when I'm out there with the guys just impact winning.

...

Good luck figuring out which is which.

1726358824.0,Artificial Intelligence Will Kill Us All,"The Union of Concerned Scientists has said that advanced AI systems pose a “direct existential threat to humanity.” Geoffrey Hinton, often called the “godfather of AI” is among many experts who have said that Artificial Intelligence will likely end in human extinction. 

Companies like OpenAI have the explicit goal of creating Artificial Superintelligence which we will be totally unable to control or understand. Massive data centers are contributing to climate collapse. And job loss alone will completely upend humanity and could cause mass hunger and mass suicide.

On Thursday, I joined a group called StopAI to block a road in front of what are rumored to be OpenAI’s new offices in downtown San Francisco. We were arrested and spent some of the night in jail.

I don’t want my family to die. I don’t want my friends to die. I choose to take nonviolent actions like blocking roads simply because they are effective. Research and literally hundreds of examples prove that blocking roads and disrupting the public more generally leads to increased support for the demand and political and social change. 

Violence will never be the answer.
